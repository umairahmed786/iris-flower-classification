Iris Flower Dataset
This repository contains the Iris Flower dataset and associated code for analysis and exploration. The dataset is a famous dataset in the field of machine learning and is often used for practicing classification algorithms.

Overview
The Iris Flower dataset includes measurements for 150 iris flowers from three different species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. Each flower sample comprises four features:

Sepal length (in centimeters)
Sepal width (in centimeters)
Petal length (in centimeters)
Petal width (in centimeters)
The goal is to predict the species of iris flowers based on these four features.

Content
iris.csv: The dataset in CSV format containing the measurements of the iris flowers.
analysis.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook file containing exploratory data analysis (EDA), data visualization, and machine learning models applied to the dataset.
requirements.txt: File listing the required Python libraries and their versions necessary to run the code.
Usage
To use this dataset and code:
