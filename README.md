# Iris Flower Dataset

This repository contains the Iris Flower dataset and associated code for analysis and exploration. The Iris Flower dataset is a well-known dataset in the realm of machine learning and is commonly used for practicing classification algorithms.

## Overview

The Iris Flower dataset comprises measurements for 150 iris flowers from three distinct species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. Each flower sample includes four features:

1. Sepal length (in centimeters)
2. Sepal width (in centimeters)
3. Petal length (in centimeters)
4. Petal width (in centimeters)

The primary objective of this dataset is to predict the species of iris flowers based on these four features.

## File Structure

- `iris.csv`: The dataset in CSV format containing measurements of the iris flowers.
- `analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook file containing exploratory data analysis (EDA), data visualization, and machine learning models applied to the dataset.
- `requirements.txt`: File listing the necessary Python libraries and their versions required to run the code.

## Usage

To utilize this dataset and associated code:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/iris-flower-dataset.git
   cd iris-flower-dataset
