# Iris Flower Dataset

This repository contains the Iris Flower dataset and associated code for analysis and exploration. The Iris Flower dataset is a well-known dataset in the realm of machine learning and is commonly used for practicing classification algorithms.

## Overview

The Iris Flower dataset comprises measurements for 150 iris flowers from three distinct species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. Each flower sample includes four features:

1. Sepal length (in centimeters)
2. Sepal width (in centimeters)
3. Petal length (in centimeters)
4. Petal width (in centimeters)

The primary objective of this dataset is to predict the species of iris flowers based on these four features.

## File Structure

- `iris.csv`: The dataset in CSV format containing measurements of the iris flowers.
- `Iris_Flower_Detection.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook file containing exploratory data analysis (EDA), data visualization, and machine learning models applied to the dataset.

## Usage

To utilize this dataset and associated code:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/umairahmed786/iris-flower-classification.git
2 Open and execute the Iris_Flower_Detection.ipynb Jupyter Notebook on Google Colab.

## Acknowledgment

The Iris Flower dataset is sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and was introduced by Ronald Fisher in 1936. It has been extensively used in various machine learning tutorials, courses, and research projects.
